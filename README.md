# open-picpak

> The open firmware, tooling and documentation the PicPak e-ink frame should have
> shipped with — no cloud, no lock-in, fully in your hands.

**open-picpak** is a clean-room, vendor-independent project around the PicPak 4.2″
e-ink photo frame: a reverse-engineering reference, runnable tools, a full custom
firmware with features the stock product never had, and a self-hostable backend.
Everything is developed in public.

## Motivation

I backed the Kickstarter because the campaign imagery showed **greens and blues** — I
assumed I was getting a mature color e-ink panel at a fair price.

What shipped was **400 × 300 BWRY**: four colors — black, white, red, yellow. No
green, no blue, no grey. That hope was gone on first refresh.

Worse, the stock firmware does the bare minimum. It is a thin, cloud-tethered image
pusher: the phone app pulls photos and firmware from the vendor cloud and shoves them
over BLE. None of what I hoped to do with the device is possible out of the box — and
the vendor had far longer to build a proper firmware than the **single day** it took
me to stand up a fully working Home Assistant WiFi pull-frame on my own firmware.

So I'm building the firmware (and the tools, and the backend) the device deserved —
**in public**, so the community gets to use it too. I won't stop before every planned
feature below is real.

---

## What this is

A full suite, built clean:

- a **documentation / reverse-engineering reference** (what the device actually is),
- a **custom ESP-IDF firmware** with features the stock never had,
- a **self-hostable backend** (Docker) that serves per-device content,
- and the **tools** to flash, configure and feed the device — without any cloud.

> **Air-gapped, no secrets.** This repository carries no real device identifiers — no
> serial numbers, MAC addresses, RF-calibration blobs, BLE keys or firmware hashes
> from any physical unit. Every such value is a format-preserving placeholder. Bring
> your own device. See the stub conventions at the top of
> [`documentation/device.md`](documentation/device.md).

## Status

### What they did — the stock product

- 4.2″ **400 × 300 BWRY** e-ink (black/white/red/yellow only; no green/blue/grey),
  full-refresh only (~19 s).
- **ESP32-C3**, **BLE-only** firmware — no WiFi linked at all.
- The **phone app is a mandatory cloud gateway**: it pulls photos and firmware from
  the vendor cloud and pushes them to the device over BLE.
- 700 image slots, no on-device configuration, no scripting, no network of its own.

### What I did

- **Reverse-engineered the device end-to-end:** hardware & pin map, flash / NVS /
  eFuse layout, MAC & serial identity, case-color encoding, the radio/brownout
  envelope, the full BLE GATT protocol (`0xFF01/02/03` incl. OTA-over-BLE), and the
  exact RGB→panel image pipeline (BT.601 nearest-color + Atkinson).
- **Built a fully working Home Assistant WiFi pull-frame in a day** on custom ESP-IDF
  firmware: wake (timer/button) → WiFi → fetch a server-rendered image → display →
  deep sleep, with **SHA-256-verified OTA over WiFi** and brownout-hardened transfers.
  It has since matured into a real run-cycle: refresh **only on a changed frame** (the
  panel's ~19 s refresh is skipped otherwise), WLAN held across cycles on USB power, a
  multi-SSID store, and a smart low-battery gate.
- **Built a recovery guard** — bootloop detection → USB-reachable safe-mode (WiFi/EPD off,
  esptool + console stay up); reset-reason-agnostic, fresh-app reset, NVS-tunable
  threshold/stable-uptime. Host-tested + on-device validated.
- **Built an on-device Berry engine** — *config is a script, not a data file*: one VM does
  config *and* procedural graphics (text, shapes, QR, live device variables) and renders the
  frame on-device. RAM feasibility validated on the C3 (VM ~3 KB, coexists with WiFi +
  framebuffer, no PSRAM); a littlefs key-value store gives scripts persistence.
- **Built a C2 command channel** — the device **long-polls** a self-hosted backend over HTTPS (a
  single poll per wake on battery), fetches a **Berry command script and runs it** on a deliberately
  safe surface (config/NVS writes, read-only queries, store, and reboot/refresh/sleep intents — no
  drawing, no OTA trigger). Per-device **ECDSA bond + session HOTP** auth (the backend stores only the
  public key), HTTPS-only because the payload is code, and the ack is persisted before the action so
  a reboot can't loop.

### What I published

- [x] [`documentation/device.md`](documentation/device.md) — hardware, memory layout,
      identity, colors, radio/brownout, BLE overview, image format
- [x] [`documentation/ble-protocol.md`](documentation/ble-protocol.md) — full stock
      BLE GATT / wire-frame / OTA spec
- [x] [`documentation/image-pipeline.md`](documentation/image-pipeline.md) —
      RGB→palette (BT.601 + Atkinson) with a runnable JS reference
- [x] [`documentation/config-engine.md`](documentation/config-engine.md) — why the config
      *is* a Berry script (mechanism = pinned C stdlib / policy = script) + the on-device result
- [x] MPL-2.0 license
- [x] [`firmware/`](firmware/) — custom ESP-IDF firmware: the **recovery guard** (bootloop →
      USB-reachable safe-mode; host-tested + on-device validated), a matured **WiFi run-cycle**
      (content-change gate, WLAN-hold, multi-SSID, smart low-battery gate, SHA-256 OTA), an
      integrated **Berry render/config engine** (a script renders the frame on-device — text +
      live device variables + shapes + QR + a Pacman; "config is a script, not a data file"), and
      a **HOTP-authenticated C2 command channel** (poll a backend, run a returned Berry command
      script over HTTPS). Validates Berry on the C3 (no PSRAM, coexists with WiFi); host-previewable.
      Battery uses the stock divider/curve recovered by disassembly.
- [x] [`backend/`](backend/) — self-hostable Docker backend: TimescaleDB + Grafana + the
      telemetry/OTA/log schema + legacy ingest, the **C2 command channel** (per-device Berry
      command queue + per-device HOTP auth), and **OTA serving + rollout management** — a single
      authoritative resolver (per-serial pin ▸ channel fleet ▸ default), firmware register with
      server-side re-hash, and a download-ticket-authorized `firmware.bin` serve (default-off until
      the field firmware is measured on-device), plus **device-log reassembly** — the WiFi log
      ride-along becomes a gapless per-device stream (offset-ack / gap / suspect / monotone seq,
      idempotent byte-exact fragments) the operator can query and live-tail
- [x] **operator control plane** (in [`backend/`](backend/)) — a bearer-authenticated admin API in a
      process and address space **separate from the public ingest parser**: device CRUD + RCE-capable
      command enqueue, and an **encrypted secrets KV** (AES-256-GCM sealed; the master key is never on
      disk in the public image and the service fails closed without it). It serves an embedded
      **operator web UI** — a Svelte 5 SPA (`//go:embed`, one binary, no CORS): key login, a live device
      roster over server-sent events, and read-only degradation for non-admin keys. The **log viewer**
      (keyset-paged history, a live SSE tail, gap/suspect markers, and gapless stream reconstruct) and the
      **telemetry dashboard** (per-device health verdicts, running version / battery / last-seen, a live
      SSE telemetry tail, and light sparklines — Grafana stays for deep time-series) ship now, as does the
      **Berry command editor** — a capability-aware CodeMirror editor over the on-device C2 safe subset
      (autocomplete + client-side lint that flags the render/policy-phase and severing calls, single-device
      or typed-`'*'`-confirmed fleet enqueue, and an honest cursor-advance feedback model: *delivered +
      attempted*, never *succeeded*, with a deep-link to the device log for the real outcome). The
      remaining feature pages — OTA rollout, FaaS editor, Web-USB onboarding — mount into this shell in
      later waves.
- [x] [`tools/`](tools/) — host-side tooling: the **picpak-ops** operator TUI
      (build / flash / console / OTA / telemetry / logs) and the air-gap gate

### What I planned

The whole point. Re-implementing everything I already have — step by step, so it stays
clean and gets refined on the way — then going far past what the stock firmware does.

**Documentation**
- [ ] flashing & backup guide (esptool params, bootloader mode, stock restore)
- [ ] reverse-engineering methodology (ESP-image → ELF, radare2, Ghidra, blutter)
- [ ] custom-firmware notes (adaptive TX, OTA block transfer, streaming-header pitfall)

**`firmware/` — custom ESP-IDF firmware (C)**
- [~] **config-/logic-engine (Berry, not TOML)** — config *is* a Berry script fetched per wake
      (rotation, intervals, OTA URL, triggers/actions); the device exposes a small pinned C stdlib,
      the script decides. Feasibility validated on-device; seed in
      [`firmware/`](firmware/). WiFi/IP stubbed off until configured.
- [~] **control actions** — landed as the **C2 command surface**: `reboot` / `refresh` / `sleep`
      intents plus config/NVS writes as Berry calls, served from the backend. A button-trigger in
      the config tool is still pending.
- [~] **embedded fonts + simple shapes** — Adafruit-GFX-style 1-bit glyph blitter (text, lines,
      rects, discs, triangles, QR codes), ~0 extra RAM; the Berry graphics stdlib in
      [`firmware/`](firmware/)
- [~] **self-debug screen** — serial, MACs, chip, uptime, reset, battery; rendered on-device
      (the `firmware/` scene already shows these)
- [ ] **playlist & rotation** — rotate stored images, configurable cycle interval,
      remote **sync playlist** (poll for updates on an interval — not yet implemented),
      single-frame remote (Home-Assistant-style backend), OTA URL
- [ ] **image store** — stored frames, exposed to the config tool as editable
      color-indexed PNGs
- [ ] **BLE / WiFi, swappable** — never both at once (RAM budget = the larger, not the
      sum); configurable swap (BLE for provisioning/OTA ↔ WiFi run-cycle), NimBLE
- [ ] **BLE-stack re-implementation** — keep the original PicPak app able to manage
      stored images (on-flash storage format TBD)
- [ ] **use the upper flash region** — make the unaddressed 16→32 MB usable for bulk
      image storage *(research — data only, not code)*
**`backend/` — Docker backend**
- [~] **scaffold** — TimescaleDB + Grafana + telemetry/OTA/log schema + legacy ingest + the
      HOTP-authed **C2 command channel** (append-only queue + per-device cursor)
- [ ] **serial-number differentiation** — serve separate frames per device
- [ ] single-frame remote backend, generalized from the Home Assistant PoC
- [ ] serves the `web-usb/` tool as static assets

**`web-usb/` — browser config & flashing tool (served by the backend)**
> Replaces a USB mass-storage interface — impossible on the ESP32-C3 (no USB-OTG) —
> with the same file-like UX over two transports: **Web-USB** (WebSerial, on the
> cable) and **Web-WiFi** (HTTP, on the network).
- [ ] flashing & stock backup / restore (esptool-js — no native install)
- [ ] config form (writes the device TOML), control-action buttons, image gallery
- [ ] image editor / uploader (built on the `image-pipeline.md` JS reference)

**`tools/` — host-side tooling**
- [~] **picpak-ops** — operator deployment TUI (build, flash, console, OTA, telemetry, logs); on-device validation pending
- [ ] BLE client (push / manage images without the phone app)
- [ ] dev & automation helpers

## Repository layout

```
documentation/      reference & reverse-engineering docs         (published)
firmware/           custom ESP-IDF firmware: recovery guard + Berry engine + C2  (in progress)
backend/            self-hostable Docker backend (TimescaleDB+Grafana+ingest) (in progress)
tools/              host-side tooling: picpak-ops TUI + air-gap gate (in progress)
web-usb/            browser config + flashing tool               (planned)
```

`web-usb/` and `backend/` are coupled: the backend ships the browser tool as static
assets, so flashing, uploading and configuring all work from one self-hosted URL.

## Flashing the firmware

### Build (optional)

Pre-built firmware binaries are available in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/faultoverload/open-PicPak/releases)
for the current stable version. If you want to build from source:

```bash
cd firmware
# Generate assets (one-time)
python3 host/gen_render.py && python3 host/gen_policy.py
# Build with Docker ESP-IDF
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/project -w /project espressif/idf:v5.5.3 \
  bash -lc "idf.py set-target esp32c3 build"
```

Output binaries land in `firmware/build/`:
| File | Flash address |
|------|--------------|
| `bootloader/bootloader.bin` | `0x0` |
| `partition_table/partition-table.bin` | `0x8000` |
| `ota_data_initial.bin` | `0x10000` |
| `picpak_fw.bin` | `0x20000` |

### Flash (esptool)

Put the PicPak in download mode: **unplug USB, hold the button, plug USB back in,
release button once the serial port appears** (usually `/dev/ttyACM0`).

Then flash all four partitions in one command:

```bash
esptool --chip esp32c3 -p /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 115200 --no-stub \
  --before default-reset --after hard-reset \
  write-flash --flash-mode dio --flash-size 16MB --flash-freq 80m \
  0x0 bootloader.bin \
  0x8000 partition-table.bin \
  0x10000 ota_data_initial.bin \
  0x20000 picpak_fw.bin
```

> **Ignore the bootloader MD5 warning.** ESP-IDF patches the SHA digest in-flash,
> changing the hash. The data is written correctly — this is a false alarm on
> esptool v5.x.

> **You MUST flash the partition table.** Skipping `0x8000` leaves the stock
> partition layout in place, which points to the old firmware at a different
> address. The device will boot the wrong code or nothing at all.

> **`--no-stub` is required for the 32 MB flash chip** (`t25s256`). Without it,
> esptool uploads a stub flasher that can't address the full chip.

After flashing: **unplug USB, plug back in, open minicom at 115200.**

### Provision (serial console)

The factory NVS partition at `0x9000` is **never touched** — the device serial,
MAC, and RF calibration survive. Provision WiFi credentials and a frame URL
once (these persist across re-flashes):

```
SETWIFI YourSSID YourPassword
SETURL  https://your-bridge.example.com/frame.bin
SETWAKE 3600
REFRESH
```

**`SETURL`** points to an HTTP(S) endpoint that serves a raw 30,000-byte BWRY
framebuffer (400×300, 2 bpp, 4 px/byte, MSB-first). The [Immich bridge](immich-bridge/)
is one such backend; any server that returns exactly 30,000 bytes of packed
BWRY data works.

Verify with `INFO` — you should see your SSID, URL, and `config: complete`.
